# Java-Project-Smart-Calculator

A calculator similar to Python's shell. Supports variable with suitable names, mathematical operations with very large numbers and also for combinations of variables and numbers. Learned to use BigInteger class, use of regex statements and creating a PostFix expression from provided mathematical statement.

Features - 
  1. Variables can be named and assigned values. Name of variables can contain only letters. Values can be assigned to variables.
  2. Once a variable is named and initialized, it is saved and can be recalled or used in a mathematical operation. 
  3. Use of BigInteger class allows mathematical operation with very very large numbers. The program runs slower because of use of BigInteger class.
  4. Mathematical expressions can contain both variables and numbers. Multiple '+' signs and multiple '-' signs are dealt with accordingly, but multiple * or / is considered as invalid 
  5. There can be multiple tabs or spaces for an input expression, which is formatted to get a recognizable expression
  6. Input mathematical expression is converted to its PostFix form. Operations are done on the basis of precedence with "()" having the highest precedence. Multiple "()" in a single expression is allowed
  7. Multiple ways of erroneous statement for which Invalid expression is printed
 
To be added - 
  1. Power function with the highest precedence
